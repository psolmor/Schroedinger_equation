# Schr-dinger_equation
This Python script is designed to address the Schr√∂dinger equation within a potential well. The results are derived through numerical discretization and by employing the Cayley approximation.


The parameters are     N, nciclos, lamda (potential), h and s. They define how the problem will be discretized.
